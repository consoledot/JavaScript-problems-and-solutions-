# The Popuar FizzBuzz problem
We take in a number, and we create a list of numbers starting from 1 to the number we entered. If the number is a muitliple of 3 and 5 we display `FizzBuzz` to the screen if it's multiple of 5 we display `Buzz` if it's 3 we display `Fizz`, then if its neither 3, 5 or both we diplay the actual number.
